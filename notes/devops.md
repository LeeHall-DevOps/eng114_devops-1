## What is DevOps

DevOps is a software methodology that combines software devlopment (Dev) with IT operations (Ops) working together in the entire service life-cycle. It is a set of practices and tools that automate processes between software development and IT teams, so that they can build, test, and release software faster.
In simpler terms, DevOps is a culture that bridges the gap between development and operation teams.
