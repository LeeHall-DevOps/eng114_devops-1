## What is S3

S3 is Simple Storage Service. 

It is a global service which means it is highly available and scalable.

You can store whatever you want on it as it's a storage platform, so anything you want to keep can be held on S3.

## What is required

On you EC2 Instance or any machine, you need

- Python3 or above
- AWS-CLI
- pip3
- AWS access & secret key for data security

## How to use it

You can use the AWS CLI and for that you need two secret keys. `An AWS Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key`.

To link your EC2 instance to AWS CLI, you would need to do 
```
sudo apt install aws-cli
```
once that is done, you then type `aws configure` to add your keys, region and language and it should look something like this, once you get this, just add your information to each field and then test to see if your connect with.
```
AWS Access Key ID: Key ID
AWS Secret Access Key: Key ID
Default region name: eu-west-1
Default output format: json
```

`aws s3 ls`
and if it worked, you should see a bunch of buckets in that s3, if there is anything in it.

1. You would first need to create a bucket (following naming conventions)
2. Then you can CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) files within the bucket.

## AWS CLI Commands

Configure CLI
```
aws configure
```

List all buckets
```
aws s3 ls
```

List bucket content
```
aws s3 ls s3://<bucket_name>
```

Make bucket
```
aws s3 mb s3://<bucket_name>
```

Remove empty bucket
```
aws s3 rb s3://<bucket_name>
```

Sync Objects
```
aws s3 sync <local> s3://<bucket_name>
```

Copy to bucket
```
aws s3 cp <object> s3://<bucket_name>
```

Copy from bucket
```
aws s3 cp s3://<bucket_name>/<object> <destination>
```

Move object
```
aws s3 mv s3://bucket/<object> <destination>
```

Remove object
```
aws s3 rm s3://<bucket>/<object>
```

Sync objects between buckets/directories
```
aws s3 sync <local> s3://<bucket>
```

## Automated CRUD with python

To create a bucket
```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

s3.create_bucket(Bucket='bucket_name', CreateBucketConfiguration={'LocationConstraint': 'eu-west-1'})
```
To delete a bucket
```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

s3.delete_bucket(Bucket = 'bucket_name')
```
To upload a file
```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

s3.upload_file(
        Filename = 'file_name',
        Bucket = 'bucket_name',
        Key = 'file_name',
        )
```
To delete a file
```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

s3.Object('bucket_name', 'file_name').delete()
```
To get file
```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

s3.download_file(
        Filename = 'file_name',
        Bucket = 'bucket_name',
        Key = 'file_name',
        )
```
