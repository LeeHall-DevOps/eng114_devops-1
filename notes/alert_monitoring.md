# Alert & Monitoring

## Why should we monitor?

We should monitor so that we don't send out a faulty product.

The aspects we should monitor are:
- error logs
- budgeting
- uptime - access time - response time
- security breaches
- system test/health
- instance's health
- CPU utilisation %
- Memory utilisation %
