## What is CICD

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivier is considered as the backbone of DevOps practices and automation, it plays a vital role in DevOps culture.

### Continuous Integration 

Developers merge/commit code to the main branch multiple times a day, full automated build and test processes which gives them feedback within a few minutes, by doing this, you are effectively avoiding the integration mayhem that happens when developers wait for the release day to merge all their changes into the release branch.

### Continuous Delivery

It's an extension of continuous integration to make sure that you can release new changes to your customers quicker in a much more sustainable method. So on top of your continuous integration, you also automated your release process and can deploy you application at any point of time by clicking a button. Deployment will have to be done manually but that can also be done automatically

### Continuous Deployment

This goes futher than Continuous Delivery by deploying the actually application online automatically, so each change that passes all the stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers, there is no human interaction so this lowers the chance for human error, and even one failed test will prevent the new change being deployed to production.

### Pipeline

A CI/CD pipeline is all about automation: Intialising the code builds, automated testing, and automated deployment to staging or production enviroments. This saves the teams a lot of time as they don't have to create the tests and this process is *incredibly fast*## What is CICD

## Why Jenkins

Jenkins has been adopted by the likes of Facebook, Netflix and Ebay because of it's incredible advantages.
